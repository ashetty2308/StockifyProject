# StockifyProject

Stockify is an android application that allows those who are new to the stock world to dip their feet into the trading & investment world.

Features:

- The latest stock market headlines and stories, so you can keep up with all of the buzzing news on Wall Street.
- Users can also search for any stock they want by the ticker symbol. After doing this, the user will have a generated graph, which depicts a 2 day trend of the stock they are
- interested in (compares yesterday's high to today's current price of the stock). It's color coded, so the user can see if it is a positive trend (green), or negative trend (red)
