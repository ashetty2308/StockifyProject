# Stockify Project

Stockify is an android application that allows those who are new to the stock world to dip their feet into the trading & investment world.

Built with: Alpha Vantage, Financial Modeling Prep, Newwsdata.io, and Firebase.

Features:

- The latest stock market headlines and stories, so you can keep up with all of the buzzing news on Wall Street.
- Ticker Symbol Search Feature: users can search by company names (i.e.; Starbucks, Microsoft, Target, Apple, etc.) to get a list of possible ticker symbols.
- Users can also search for any stock they want by the ticker symbol. After doing this, the user will have a generated graph, which depicts a 2 day trend of the stock they are interested in (compares yesterday's high to today's current price of the stock). 
  - It's color coded, so the user can see if it is a positive trend (green), or negative trend (red)
- Users can save any news headlines that they want.
- These articles are connected to firebase, and the saved headlines are displayed in the "Saved" section of the app, where a list of all the headines saved will appear.
